# Evaluating Lightness Models


Parameterizations
- Parameterizations that (might) quantitatively change model prediction and psychophysical performance, e.g., carrier grating sf
- Parameterizations that (might) qualitatively change model prediction and perception, e.g., multiple targets that form an illusory surface
- Inventory could be used to identify parameterizations of stimuli for which models diverge

Metrics
- Sign / direction of effect (qualitative)
- Semi-quantitative comparisons for stimulus pairs ("Does the model predict a stronger brightness difference in stimulus X as compared to stimulus Y?", e.g. Murray2020)
- Testing the models on "control stimuli" that elicit no strong illusion in humans (e.g. connected Koffka-Ring, see Murray2020): the models should not predict large differences in these controls
- How to quantify target brightness, from model output image
- Blakeslee & McCourt's way of estimating target brightness (spatial average ?)
- Robinson, Hammon & de Sa way of estimating target brightness (target meridian ? )
- Some filling-in algorithm to fill-in target region brightness estimate ?

Tasks
- Brightness estimation
- Tests for glow, codetermination and articulation (see Murray2020)
- Brightness estimation in (narrowband) noise (see Betz, Shapley, Wichmann, & Maertens, 2015; Salmela & Laurinen, 2009)
- Brightness estimation after contour adaptation (Anstis & Greenlee, 2013; Anstis, 2014)
- Brightness estimation after flicker adaptation (Robinson & de Sa, 2012; 2013)
